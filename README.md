This repository focuses on the **5Pils dataset**, introduced by [Tonglet et al. (2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.448). It aims to generate **more explainable 5Pils responses** by incorporating the key elements (e.g., **Source**, **Date**, **Location**, **Motivation**) and supplementing them with additional context. Furthermore, the framework introduces a **confidence level** that indicates the reliability of generated responses, leveraging our novel approach for enhanced interpretability.
