# 5PilsPlus

This project repository focuses on the 5Pils dataset and aims to produce more explainable 5Pils responses. The generated answers will include key elements, as described in 5Pils, such as Source, Date, Location, and Motivation, along with additional details to enhance the explanations. Additionally, the framework introduces a confidence level to indicate the reliability of the generated responses, utilizing our novel approach.
