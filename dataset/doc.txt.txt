5Pils dataset - V1.0


Description: The 5Pils dataset consists of 1,676 fact-checked images annotated with question-answer pairs based on the 5 Pillars framework for image contextualization. 
The dataset annotations are contained in the train.json, val.json, and test.json files of the dataset folder. 
More information about the dataset structure can be found in the README file.

❕Content warning ❕
5Pils contains examples of real-world misinformation. Due to the real-world nature of the data, events covered include wars and conflicts. 
As a result, some images contain graphic, violent content. When collecting the data, 
we decided not to filter out images with violent content to cover the actual distribution of images that our target users, 
professional fact-checkers, would want to provide as input. Given the graphic nature of some images, we do not release them directly. 
Instead, we do publicly release the URLs of the FC articles, as well as the script that allows to collect and process the images.
